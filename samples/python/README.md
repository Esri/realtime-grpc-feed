This is an example of how to construct a gRPC client in Python. Additional documentation can be found [here](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/python/).

Before running the script, make sure you have Python 3.5 or higher and pip version 9.0.1 or higher. You will also need gRPC and Pythonâ€™s gRPC tools installed. The prerequisites and instructions for downloading are [here](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/python/quickstart/).

The two python files: `velocity_grpc_pb2_grpc.py` and `velocity_grpc_pb2.py` are generated by the gRPC Python protocol compiler plugin. Do not edit them. To run the example, replace the variables in `velocity_grpc_python_client.py` with your own and use Python to run it.

In this example, the client sends unary requests synchronously to the server, which in this case is the gRPC feed created on Velocity. This means each sent request will receive a single response from Velocity, and no request will be sent until a response has been received for the previous request. gRPC also allows other types of RPCs(client-streaming, server-streaming, etc.) for which the documentation can be found [here](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/#rpc-life-cycle). However, according to the [official documentation](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/performance/#python), streaming RPCs are not recommended in Python and thus no examples are provided here. For the same reason, there isn't an example implementing the asynchronous flavor of RPCs.
