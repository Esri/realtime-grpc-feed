This is an example of how to construct a gRPC client in Python. Additional documentation can be found [here](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/python/).

Before running the script, make sure you have Python 3.5 or higher and pip version 9.0.1 or higher. You will also need gRPC and Pythonâ€™s gRPC tools installed. The prerequisites and instructions for downloading can be found [here](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/python/quickstart/).

In this example, the client sends unary requests synchronously to the server, which in this case is the gRPC feed created on Velocity. This means each sent request will receive a single response from Velocity, and no request will be sent until a response has been received for the previous request. gRPC also allows other types of RPCs(client-streaming, server-streaming, etc.) for which the documentation can be found [here](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/#rpc-life-cycle). However, according to the [official documentation](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/performance/#python), streaming RPCs are not recommended in Python and thus no examples are provided here. For the same reason, there isn't an example implementing the asynchronous flavor of RPCs.
