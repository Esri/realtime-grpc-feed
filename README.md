# velocity-grpc-client
Developers, follow these instructions to get going:



in this repo are: 

### libs:
language-specific libraries compiled from the velocity_grpc.proto file, below, for use in your grpc client code.



### samples: 
sample code illustrating how to leverage the precompiled libraries, above, in your client code.



### velocity_grpc.proto: 
you don't need this if you use the precompiled libraries for your environment. However, if you really want it so you can create files identical to our precompiled libraries (see libs, above) feel free...
